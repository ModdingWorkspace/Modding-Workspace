Modding-Workspace
=================

A private shared workspace for sharing, helping and uploading our main code for our mod/s
(I don't understand the concept of GitHub, so I put my main in some new branch. Mod is going smoothly and stuff. You haven't been on, so I started one of my 1.6.4 mods again. Mainly because I liked the concept and textures, but anyways, it should be done soon. This is a very long line. Does it ever go down without pressing enter? - Sean)
